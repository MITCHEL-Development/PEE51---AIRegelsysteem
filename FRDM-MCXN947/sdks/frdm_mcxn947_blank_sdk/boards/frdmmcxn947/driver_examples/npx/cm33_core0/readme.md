## Overview
This driver example should demonstrate how to setup NPX driver for on the fly encryption/decryption of data stored in flash memory region.
The NPX is configured for the on fly encryption/decryption all data starting from location 0x001A0000 to 0x001AFFFF.
The example enable NPX, writen data is on the fly encrypted into specified region, when NPX is enabled read from that region is same as data writen as NPX performs on the fly decryption.
Then NPX is disabled and readed data doesnt match expected value as on the fly decryption didnt happen

## Running the demo
The log below shows example output of the NPX driver demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NPX Example.
API_Init Successfully!
 NPX was successfully configured for memory encryption/decryption from 0x1a0000 to 0x1affff.
*Success* read programmed&encrypted data from 0x1a0000 to 0x1affff match expected pattern.
*Success* read at 0x1a0000 to 0x1affff doesnt match expected pattern.
Example end.
